# Enhanced Docker Management System

## Overview

The Docker management system has been significantly improved to address the issues you identified. Here's what's been implemented:

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Container Reuse for Failed Executions**
- **Problem**: Previously, containers were destroyed after execution failure
- **Solution**: Containers are now preserved when code execution fails but the Docker build succeeded
- **Benefit**: Allows debugging and iterative development without rebuilding images

### 2. **AI-Generated Dockerfiles with Debuggable Templates**
- **Problem**: Hard-coded templates limited flexibility
- **Solution**: AI analyzes code and generates custom Dockerfiles with:
  - Proper base image selection
  - Security best practices (non-root user)
  - Debugging capabilities
  - Task-specific optimizations
- **Fallback**: Robust template system when AI is unavailable

### 3. **Automatic Container Management**
- **Problem**: Too many user prompts during execution
- **Solution**: 
  - No prompts during code execution
  - Automatic image name generation based on task analysis
  - Smart container reuse logic
  - Development containers with persistent state

### 4. **Graceful Ctrl+C Handling**
- **Problem**: No graceful shutdown on interruption
- **Solution**: Signal handler that:
  - Detects keyboard interrupts
  - Asks user about saving development containers
  - Provides session cleanup options
  - Preserves work for future sessions

### 5. **Session-End Cleanup Only**
- **Problem**: Frequent cleanup prompts during development
- **Solution**: Cleanup only occurs:
  - At natural session end
  - On Ctrl+C interruption
  - When explicitly requested

## New Features

### Container Development Sessions
- **Persistent Containers**: Long-running containers for iterative development
- **Session History**: Track files and changes within containers
- **Container Reuse**: Resume work in existing containers
- **Chat History**: Potential for maintaining context across restarts

### Improved Error Handling
- **Build vs Runtime Separation**: Different handling for build failures vs execution failures
- **AI Debugging**: Automatic Dockerfile correction on build failures
- **Container Preservation**: Failed containers kept for debugging

### Smart Image Management
- **Task-Based Naming**: Automatic naming based on code analysis
- **Category Detection**: data_analysis, web_dev, machine_learning, scientific, general
- **Package Optimization**: Intelligent dependency selection
- **Reuse Logic**: Efficient image caching and reuse

## Technical Implementation

### New Files and Methods

#### `AgenticDockerManager` Extensions:
- `check_existing_containers()`: List available development containers
- `create_or_reuse_container()`: Smart container lifecycle management
- `execute_in_container()`: Run code in persistent containers
- `setup_signal_handler()`: Graceful Ctrl+C handling
- `_load_managed_containers()`: Container state persistence

#### `execution.py` Updates:
- `_run_docker()`: Enhanced with container reuse
- `_run_docker_oneshot()`: Fallback for simple executions
- Removed user prompts during execution

### Configuration Files
- `docker/managed_containers.json`: Tracks development containers
- `docker/managed_images.json`: Enhanced image tracking
- Automatic cleanup of session files

## Usage Examples

### Basic Development Session
```bash
# User runs code - system automatically:
# 1. Analyzes code requirements
# 2. Builds optimized Docker image
# 3. Creates development container
# 4. Executes code

# On subsequent runs:
# 1. Offers to reuse existing containers
# 2. Maintains session state
# 3. Preserves installed packages
```

### Error Recovery
```bash
# If code fails:
# 1. Container is preserved for debugging
# 2. User can fix code and re-run in same container
# 3. No need to rebuild environment

# If Docker build fails:
# 1. AI attempts to fix Dockerfile
# 2. Retries build with corrections
# 3. Falls back to basic image if needed
```

### Session Management
```bash
# On Ctrl+C:
# 1. System asks about saving development containers
# 2. Offers cleanup options
# 3. Preserves work for future sessions

# On normal exit:
# 1. Shows all managed resources
# 2. Allows selective cleanup
# 3. Keeps useful containers for reuse
```

## Benefits

1. **Faster Development**: Container reuse eliminates rebuild overhead
2. **Better Debugging**: Failed containers preserved for inspection
3. **Smoother UX**: Fewer interruptions and prompts
4. **Resource Efficiency**: Smart cleanup and reuse
5. **Robust Recovery**: Multiple fallback strategies
6. **Persistent Sessions**: Work can continue across restarts

## Migration

The enhanced system is backward compatible:
- Existing functionality preserved
- Old containers will be detected and offered for reuse
- Gradual migration to new container management
- No breaking changes to API

## Future Enhancements

- **Container Chat History**: Maintain conversation context across sessions
- **Multi-Container Development**: Support for complex multi-service applications
- **Resource Monitoring**: Track container resource usage
- **Snapshot Management**: Save/restore container states
